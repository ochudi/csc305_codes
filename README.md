# CSC305 Codes

This repository contains code examples and projects related to the Operating Systems II course (CSC305). The codes cover various topics and concepts explored in the lectures, including process management, memory management, file systems, concurrency, and synchronization.

All the code examples are implemented primarily in Rust, providing practical insights into operating systems' inner workings. This repository serves as a valuable resource for students and enthusiasts looking to deepen their understanding of operating systems.

Feel free to explore the different directories and code files to learn more about the implementation details and experiment with the code on your own.

## Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- `barest/`: Code examples and projects related to the bare-metal programming aspects of operating systems.
- `hello_world/`: Simple "Hello, World!" code examples for various operating systems concepts.
- `rust_by_example/`: Comprehensive code examples showcasing Rust implementations of various operating systems concepts.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository using the following command:
`bash
git clone https://github.com/ochudi/csc305_codes.git
